# ONE SEVEN AI - Web Content Synthesizer

## Overview

ONE SEVEN AI is a web-based interface that can analyze the content of any given URL and provide a high-quality, professional summary of the main article text or extract the most relevant keywords.

## Features

- **Professional Summarization:** Intelligently identifies the main article content on a webpage, cleans it of all irrelevant "junk" (like menus, sidebars, and footers), and provides a concise, easy-to-read summary.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Analyzes the cleaned article text to extract the most relevant keywords and topics.
- **Interactive 3D Interface:** Features a dynamic, futuristic user interface with an animated 3D particle background.
